## The power of telling data stories with plots

Welcome to Pymaceuticals. In this Bootcamp Matplotlip Project the power of data story telling is explored by creating bar charts, pie chart, scatter plots, box plots and scatter plots with linear regression.

## Scenario
The company, Pymaceuticals, Inc. specializes on developing pharmaceuticals to treat cancer. Pymaceuticals began screening potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. The company recently conducted an animal study to compare the performance of their drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. Pymaceuticalsâ€™ executive team requested an analysis of the data collected from the animal study.

## Summary Report - Pymaceuticals Analysis
Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. The data below was analysed for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In the study conducted, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated using a variety of drug regimens. The measurement and obseravtion of tumor growth was conducted over a period of 45 days. The following observations were made from the data collected:

Of the 249 sample mice, one mouse had duplicate data and was therefore removed from the data set. The gender ditribution of the 248 participating mice was 51% male and 49% female.

A total of 10 different treatment regimes were analysed in the study. The four most promising treatments were Capomulin, Ceftamin, Infubinol and Ramicane.

Capomulin and Ramicane showed the highest reduction in tumor volume over the 45 day periode. This may indicate that these two drugs are the most effective in reducing tumor size in mice.

During assessment of Final Tumor Volume in comparisson to Drug regime an outlier was identified for Infubinol.

The correclation coefficient between mouse weight and tumor volume was 0.84. This indicates a strong positive correclation between an increase in mouse weight resulting in an increase in tumor volume.
